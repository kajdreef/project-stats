# Small infrastructure to get some statistics on a set of projects

Goal of the project is to create a tool that quickly gives some statistics about the projects I use for research purposes.

## Plugins:
- [x] Detect build system (limited to: gradle, maven, bazel, and ant).
- [x] Number of contributors
- [ ] Line count (maybe use scc or cloc?)
- [ ] Number of test methods
- [ ] Get information from github

## Resources:
